## Implemente app with react


## Introduction

Hello everyone, In this project you will build our pocket movie app in which we will keep track of our favorite movies and set up a watch later list. You will use the ReactJs knowledge that you accumulated in previous projects to build the interface and show data from an API.

#### Read or watch

- [Vite | docs](https://vite.dev/guide/)
- [React Hooks](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [React Font Awesome](https://docs.fontawesome.com/v5/web/use-with/react)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

### Learning Objectives

- Manage state and props in a react component
- Use React hooks to achieve certain behavior
- Implement a design with JSX and CSS (React)
- Implement a frontend app with React

### Requirements

- Class components are not allowed
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Try to use ES6 features

### Setting up the backend

- Installing `docker`
  - This [link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) has all the steps needed for installing docker depending on your system.
- Installing `docker-compose`
  - Official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for installing docker-compose
- Make sure that docker is running before proceeding
- Cloning and running the backend server
    - Clone this [repository](https://github.com/hs-hq/holbertonschool-cinema-guru-API) on your local machine
    - cd into the repository folder and run the following commands:
        ```
        docker-compose build --no-cache --force-rm
        docker-compose up
        ```
      - After running the above command you should get an output similar to this indicating that the backend and db are running.
